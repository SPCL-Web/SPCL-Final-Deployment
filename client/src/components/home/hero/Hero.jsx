            With changing times, educational needs are also changing. In
            ancient times, students followed the Guru in a gurukul system.
            This system provided enough space for students to form bonds with
            their Gurus. In modern times, due to Demographic hindrances and
            cutthroat competitions, there is little scope for bonds to form.
